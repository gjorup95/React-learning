# React session #4 - Userinput, Requests, ListBuilding and RefDOM
This session provides information of how we can handle user input, debounce and utilise the input for carrying out API requests.
It also shows how we primarily use .map, .filter to create JSX that renders lists to be displayed on our page.
Further more it displays a general react app structure and how we reference DOM objects through react useRef.
